            Cycling
          </p>
          Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport. People
          engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists", "bicyclists", or "bikers". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles,
          "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles
          (HPVs).
          Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide.They are the principal
          means of transportation in many parts of the world.
          Cycling is widely regarded as an effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate
          distances.
          Bicycles provide numerous possible benefits in comparison with motor vehicles, including the sustained physical
          exercise involved in cycling, easier parking, increased maneuverability, and access to roads, bike paths and rural
          trails. Cycling also offers a reduced consumption of fossil fuels, less air or noise pollution, reduced greenhouse gas
          emissions, and greatly reduced traffic congestion.These have a lower financial cost for users as well as for society
          at large (negligible damage to roads, less road area required). By fitting bicycle racks on the front of buses,
          transit agencies can significantly increase the areas they can serve.
          In addition, cycling provides a variety of health benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that cycling
          can reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease, and diabetes that are prevalent in sedentary lifestyles. Cycling on
          stationary bikes have also been used as part of rehabilitation for lower limb injuries, particularly after hip
          surgery.Individuals who cycle regularly have also reported mental health improvements, including less perceived stress
          and better vitality.

            Skiing
          </p>
          Skiing has a history of almost five millennia. Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, it
          may have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in what is now China, according to an interpretation of ancient
          paintings. However, this continues to be debated. The word "ski" is one of a handful of words that Norway has exported
          to the international community. It comes from the Old Norse word "skíð" which means "split piece of wood or firewood".
          Asymmetrical skis were used in northern Finland and Sweden until at least the late 19th century. On one foot, the
          skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and a shorter ski was worn on the other foot for kicking. The
          underside of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting
          the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in a similar manner to modern ski waxing.
          Early skiers used one long pole or spear. The first depiction of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741.
          Troops on continental Europe were equipped with skis by 1747.
          Skiing was primarily used for transport until the mid-19th century, but since then has also become a recreation and
          sport.Military ski races were held in Norway during the 18th century, and ski warfare was studied in the late 18th
          century.As equipment evolved and ski lifts were developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, two main
          genres of skiing emerged—Alpine (downhill) skiing and Nordic skiing. The main difference between the two is the type
          of ski binding (the way in which the ski boots are attached to the skis).

            Running
          </p>
          Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a
          type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are
          exceptions).This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept
          mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A
          feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy
          within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle
          elasticity.The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.
